## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS


- MATHCAD PRIME 5.0
- AUTOCAD ELECTRICAL

## ABOUT THE PROJECT

```
In this project 102VA corelimb transformer is designed. Firstly, calculations done using the mathcad 
and then it is designed using the autocad. Later, the hardware model is built using the calculated 
data from the mathcad and autocad.
